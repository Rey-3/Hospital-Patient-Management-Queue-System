Hospital Patient Management Queue System
This project is a simple patient management queue system designed for hospitals. After registering a patient's personal information, the system can sort the patients according to their age (or other criteria) and provides functionalities such as removing a patient from the queue when needed.

Features
Patient Registration:
Record and store basic personal information for each patient.

Queue Management:
Manage a list of patients in a queue. New patients can be added, and patients can be removed when their consultation or treatment is complete.

Sorting Functionality:
Sort the patients based on certain criteria such as age, ensuring that the most urgent or appropriate cases are prioritized in the queue.
